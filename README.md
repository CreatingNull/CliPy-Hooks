# ![NullTek Documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CreatingNull/NullTek-Assets/main/img/logo/NullTekDocumentationLogo.png) Pre-Commit PyCLI

This project is a library handling generic execution of command line interfaces using python.
The intended use-case is for creating new [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks without fussing over the boilerplate of managing the CLI.

Credit to pocc's awesome [pre-commit hooks](https://github.com/pocc/pre-commit-hooks) as he wrote the underlying class as part of his C linters.
